# Min-entropy Evaluation

This folder contains the instructions and links to the input and output of the NIST SP 800 90B tests to evaluate min-entropy of fingerprints generated by the FastZIP zero-interaction scheme from the paper "FastZIP: Faster and More Secure Zero-Interaction Pairing", by Mikhail Fomichev, Julia Hesse, Lars Almon, Timm Lippert, Jun Han, Matthias Hollick, in Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services (MobiSys '21).

## Getting Started

The input and output data for the min-entropy evaluation can be found under "[fastzip-results/min_entropy](https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4911390)". 

Each test was conducted via the following command: 

*ea_non_iid -a -i -vv $input-file > $input-file.800-90b.log*

The dataset (see "fastzip-results/min_entropy") contains 4 individual sets of data:

- Full entropy with individual sensors modalities (full/1x/)
- Full entropy with fused sensor modalities (full/fused/)
- Reduced entropy with individual sensor modalities (reduced/1x)
- Reduced entropy with fused sensor modalities (reduced/fused)

The output of each run was joined in a text and a csv file named all.txt/all.csv.

In the paper we stated the assessed min entropy.

Code of the used NIST SP800-90B tests can be found here:

We used commit ba92f0ddeff50e6f333d8abc668d58dd7b0fb0b6 from May 21 12:51:46 2019.
